"""Request-scoped workspace filter for the assessment.

The activity-based signals (Genie Agents, Adoption, Domains top-accessed) read
account-level system tables (``system.access.audit``, ``system.query.history``,
``system.access.table_lineage``) that all carry a ``workspace_id``. On a shared
metastore those reads would otherwise count every workspace in the account. The
UI lets the user pick which workspaces are in scope (searchable include/exclude,
defaulting to the deployed workspace); the assess route records that choice here
and the probes turn it into a parameterized SQL predicate.

Metastore-scoped signals (UC Foundation, Metadata, Relationships, Metrics, and
the Domains tag proxy) read ``information_schema``/tags, which are NOT
workspace-attributable — the filter does not apply to them, and the UI says so.

Scoped to the current task context exactly like the OBO token and progress sink:
the assess handler calls ``set_workspace_filter`` before dispatching probes, and
contextvars are copied into each probe task, so a probe reads the filter without
any change to its call signature.
