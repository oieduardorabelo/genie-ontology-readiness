{_accelerator_catalog()}

{methodology_prompt()}

Keep it tight and scannable — no filler, no generic multi-phase project plan. The document already opens with a deterministic score summary, so do NOT restate the score table; start directly at "Where you are". Produce exactly these sections:
1. **Where you are** — 2-3 sentences on their readiness, tied to their overall score/stage and their biggest levers (the lowest-scoring, highest-weight pillars).
2. **Top recommendations** — the 4-6 highest-impact actions, prioritized worst-gap first. Each bullet must: (a) name the specific pillar/gap it closes, (b) give the concrete technical step AND the business/ownership step, and (c) where one applies, name the relevant accelerator above with its link.
3. **Suggested sequence** — a NUMBERED list of clear, tactical steps the customer can follow in order (what to do first → next). Each step is a concrete action (e.g. "Declare PK/FK constraints on your 8 gold fact tables"), not a theme. Where the work involves building metric views, Genie Agents, or domain tags, follow the BUILD METHODOLOGY above — reflect its phases and non-negotiable techniques (one source per metric view, validate one measure at a time, base views for multi-fact KPIs, one focused Genie Agent per domain, benchmark + regression-test). Make these specific enough to hand to a data team.

Do not invent scores or accelerators that are not listed above. Be specific to the assessment numbers."""


def _strip_document_h1(markdown_text: str) -> str:
    """Remove the FIRST top-level H1 from the plan Markdown (the redundant title).

    Fixes the duplicated-opening-line bug (issue #21): the PDF route renders the
    document title itself (``<h1>{title}</h1>``), but the generated plan body also
    tends to open with its own ``# <title>`` heading (the model adds one despite the
    prompt), so the title rendered twice in the exported PDF. We remove that title by
    structure — the first H1 — not by matching its text, so it's robust to the model
    rephrasing the title or using a different dash. Only the FIRST H1 is removed: a
    later legitimate ``# Appendix``-style heading is left intact (removing every H1
    would orphan its content under the preceding section).

    Matching details:
    - ATX H1 is a single ``#`` (not ``##``) with up to 3 leading spaces; Python-
      Markdown treats ``#Title`` (no space after ``#``) as an H1 too, so the space is
      optional here — otherwise a space-less title would slip through and still dup.
    - Setext H1 (a text line underlined by ``===``) is handled.
    - Fenced code blocks are respected: a ``# comment`` inside a ``` / ~~~ fence is
      code, not a heading. The closing fence must use the same character and be at
      least as long as the opening one (CommonMark), so a longer outer fence isn't
      closed early by a shorter inner one."""
