"""Compare two assessment snapshots — a deterministic, per-pillar diff (issue #12).

Scores are a pure function of the findings, so two stored snapshots are directly
comparable with no re-probing of the live workspace. This module turns two stored
scorecards into a per-pillar delta (gain / loss), the overall-score delta, and any
maturity-level or readiness-stage crossing.

Shape mismatches are handled explicitly so a pillar that is present on only one
side — added since the baseline, or unavailable/degraded on one run — renders as
"new" / "no longer assessed" rather than a misleading full-swing ±score. An
*unavailable* pillar (stored score 0 because the SP couldn't read it) is treated
as "no comparable score", not as a real 0, for the same reason.

Pure and free of I/O so it unit-tests without Lakebase.
